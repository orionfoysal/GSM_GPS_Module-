To work with Arduino Mega and GSM library the Rx pin of the serial communication in Mega is D10 and Tx is 
D3. (The library uses pin 2 and 3 but pin 2 on Mega is not an interrupt pin which is on Uno)

To work with Hyperterminal and GSM shield :
-> open Hyperterminal
-> choose a new connection -> select port -> Baud rate (typically 19200)Data bits 8 -> parity None -> Stop bits 1 -> Flow control None 
-> Go to File -> properties -> settings -> ASCII setup -> Mark Send Line ends with the line feeds and Append line feeds to incoming line ends

-> VIOLA !!
